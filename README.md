# PokéSearch Dex
A react project powered by the popular RESTful Pokémon API, [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It utilizes React Router to navigate throughout the site and Redux to keep track of state that needs to persist between pages. This react app also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as well as custom CSS to provide a responsive and interactive experience for the user. It's a simple look up site with a surprising amount of functionality and features under the hood. While working on this project, I used [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to run a local database so that I didn't overuse the actual API while I was testing its functionality.
